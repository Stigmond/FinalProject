# FinalProject

## Overview

For our final group project we have built a Spring application that allows users to locate and review BBQ restaurants. When a user enters the application they will have the ability to view all info but only registered users will have access to CRUD operations. CRUD operations include adding restaurants, main and side dishes, reviews, and user info.
